**Intern ID:CT04DR981**

**Domain: C++**

**Duration:OCTOBER TO NOVEMBER 2025**

**Objective**
The overall goal of this internship is to strengthen practical C++ programming skills through real-world projects covering file handling, multithreading & performance optimization, game development, and compiler design basics. These tasks aim to improve coding proficiency, logical thinking, and problem-solving while familiarizing you with important development tools and libraries.

**Key Activities**
**File Handling Tool**

Read, write, and append data to text files. Learn and implement C++ file I/O operations. Multithreaded File Compression Tool

Implement file compression and decompression. Use multithreading to enhance speed and efficiency. Graphical Snake Game

Develop an interactive game using SFML or SDL libraries. Add sound effects and increasing difficulty levels. Simple Compiler for Arithmetic Expressions
Parse and evaluate basic arithmetic expressions.
Learn fundamentals of compiler design (lexical analysis, parsing, evaluation). Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: C++

**Libraries:**

SFML or SDL (for graphical Snake game development) Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures and algorithms and related libraries for multithreading for file handling Concepts Covered:


File I/O Multithreading Data compression Game loop design & event handling Compiler parsing and evaluation Tools:

PROGRAMIZ/ Visual Studio / g++ compiler GitHub for version control Internet resources (YouTube, Google, ChatGPT for learning support)
